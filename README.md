- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Deef84
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in business, enterprise design, programming and learning tech in general. I believe in co-design and translate concepts into practice. Theory is good, but does not solve problems in their own context.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Databricks and Data Management.
